People who have a previous version of RPirrigate installed
(with Mysql as database)

* if they wish to save the data of current installation *
( preferences, modules, irrigation plans, logs)

MUST migrate the database

To do so:

AFTER having updated the RPirrigate files ( replaced the folders daemon, web and added the folder data )

BEFORE reloading RPirrigate ( command service rpirrigate restart )

NECESSARY COMMANDS:

cd into the install folder inside the downloaded zip and give following commands

# chmod a+x mysql2sqlite.sh

# ./mysql2sqlite.sh -u root dbRpirrigate | sqlite3 /srv/rpirrigate/data/database.sqlite


NOTE: if you have set up the root password to Mysql, instead of the previous command, give the following:


# ./mysql2sqlite.sh -u root -p dbRpirrigate | sqlite3 /srv/rpirrigate/data/database.sqlite

(will ask you for the password)

NOW... if you do not use mysql for any other reason, you can uninstall it

NOTE: I dont take any responsibility if you use MYSQL for other reasons and you uninstall it


# apt-get purge mysql
# apt-get --purge autoremove
